# Spotify_Project
MSBA collab on analyzing a spotify dataset

This Git Hub page is used for MSBA Database Management Project Group's final project management.
We will be working on a song.db file that contains thousands of song data point and analyze their impacts on the music's popularity.

We will use Git as a management tool by synching our sql script in the python environment. Before starting to read the followiing instructions, please download and install Git to your system.

Instructions for starting the project:

1. Go to the email I sent to all members in the group and download the db file to your local directory
2. In the same directory, open Visual Studio Code; in the command palette (the top search bar) typed in ">clone", and then use the HTTP link in this page to clone the project to your local directory
3. Use project.py to write your sql code, and then commit your changes in work control in Visual Studio Code. Make sure to add comments to the work you did.
